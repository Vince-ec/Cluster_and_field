For the z=1.6 cluster, I think our plan is: 

1. Get the z=1.62 cluster G102 data and G141 data (latter from 3DHST)


(2. Reextract everything using Grlzli).  


3. Fit G102 + G141 for z~1.6 samples


4. Do comparisons. 


5. Add new steps and repeat (dust attenuation, extract everything with Grizli).

Look at these papers and data: 

Information on the HST morphologies of galaxies in the cluster:   
http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...750...93P

Then we got grism data on the cluster galaxies (10 orbits in G102 and some WFC3 YJH and ACS BV(?) imaging).     
See the attached proposal: 

There was an early paper by a collaborator to measure D4000 from these data:

Beware in your interpretation that effects of environment may not be seen b/c everything is in overdense environment:
